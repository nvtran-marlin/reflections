The Sankey graph illustrates a computer science student's job application results. Flow logic is well-defined, facilitating a 
seamless understanding of the journey from application to outcome. Line thickness reflects relative proportions, emphasizing key transitions. The intuitive color scheme differentiates stages
like application, interviews, and outcomes. The graph captures the dynamics of the job application process, providing insights into the candidate's experiences. The layout is organized,
contributing to an aesthetically pleasing presentation. Numerical values add quantitative context, enriching understanding. I do not like the font used, as it is too big and hinder the
visibility of the thinner line. Overall, this Sankey graph did a good job of communicates the complexities of this CS student's job application journey in a simple and appealing way.
